BEFORE vs AFTER COMPARISON
================================================================================

BEFORE (with commented code):
- PROFILE_server.py: Mixed code with empty lines
- Clean-client2.py: 893 lines of old commented experimental code
- Unprofessional appearance
- Confusing for reviewers

AFTER (cleaned):
- PROFILE_server.py: Starts immediately with imports
- Clean-client2.py: Clean functional code only
- Professional, publication-ready
- Clear for reviewers to read and reproduce

================================================================================
STATUS: ✅ READY FOR IEEE SaTML 2026 SUBMISSION
================================================================================

All code is now clean, professional, and ready for reviewer scrutiny.
No development artifacts, no commented experiments, no debug code.
Pure functional code that reviewers can read, understand, and run.
