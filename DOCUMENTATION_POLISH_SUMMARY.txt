DOCUMENTATION POLISHING FOR TOP-TIER CONFERENCE REVIEW
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Make all documentation suitable for IEEE SaTML 2026 review
APPROACH: Remove speculation, exaggerations, emojis. Keep only verifiable claims.

================================================================================
KEY IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED
================================================================================

1. PROFESSIONALISM
   ❌ Removed: All emojis (🎯 🚀 📦 🔬 📊 ✅ etc.)
   ❌ Removed: Exaggerated warnings ("CRITICAL!", "MUST!", "⚠️")
   ❌ Removed: Unnecessary capitalization and emphasis
   ✅ Adopted: Clean, technical, conference-appropriate tone

2. PRECISION
   ❌ Removed: Vague claims ("similar clients", "strong privacy")
   ❌ Removed: Unverifiable time estimates ("~1 hour", "30-50 hours")
   ❌ Removed: Fragile line number references ("lines 1382-2514")
   ✅ Added: Specific, measurable claims (5×2×3=30 experiments)
   ✅ Added: Verifiable metrics (n=262144, 50 clients, 16 buckets)

3. RIGOR
   ❌ Removed: Speculation ("acceptable overhead", "privacy-critical apps")
   ❌ Removed: Unlogged metrics (communication cost, training time)
   ❌ Removed: Comparisons to other libraries (unnecessary criticism)
   ✅ Kept: Only what reviewers can verify from logs/code
   ✅ Added: References to logged values ("Flwr Default FedAvg Execution Time")

4. CONCISENESS
   ❌ Removed: Redundant explanations and step-by-step repetition
   ❌ Removed: Multiple verification methods (kept automated script)
   ❌ Removed: Unnecessary security warnings (this is FOR reviewers)
   ✅ Simplified: Installation steps (refer to automated script)
   ✅ Consolidated: Documentation file list (4 essential files)

FILE-BY-FILE CHANGES
================================================================================

README.md (145 lines, was 179):
-----------------------------------
BEFORE:
- "**Private Repository - Do Not Share**"
- "🎯 Overview", "📦 What's Included", "🚀 Quick Start"
- "YOUR_USERNAME/profile-ablation.git"
- "~1 hour", "30-50 hours"
- "✅ All 6 tests pass"

AFTER:
- Professional title only
- Clean section headers (no emojis)
- "knowledge-bin/Private.git" (correct URL)
- Removed time estimates (hardware-dependent)
- "6/6 tests pass"
- Added table with checkmarks for ablation configs
- Precise: "5 configurations × 2 attacks × 3 seeds = 30 experiments"

DEPENDENCIES.md (110 lines, was 273):
-----------------------------------
BEFORE:
- "⚠️ **CRITICAL**: You MUST use these custom versions"
- "**Purpose**: **Complete PROFILE system**..."  
- Multiple redundant installation methods
- Line number claims: "(lines 1382-2514)"
- Comparisons: "Microsoft SEAL doesn't support multi-key"

AFTER:
- "Standard pip install flwr installs base Flower without PROFILE features"
- Removed all "CRITICAL" warnings (3 instances)
- Single installation section (refers to automated script)
- Removed fragile line references
- Removed unnecessary library comparisons
- Focus: What's modified, how to verify

HE_COST_ANALYSIS.md (57 lines, was 134):
-----------------------------------
BEFORE:
- "The ~70s HE overhead per round is acceptable because:"
- Communication cost speculation (~531 GB total)
- "GPU acceleration for HE operations is future work"
- Three extraction methods (redundant)
- Vague recommendations section

AFTER:
- State facts only: "Overhead factor: ~350,000×"
- Removed all speculation about "acceptable"
- Removed communication cost (not logged, unverifiable)
- Removed future work mentions (out of scope)
- Single extraction method (automated script)
- Clear verification commands only

================================================================================
PROBLEMATIC CLAIMS REMOVED
================================================================================

1. "Groups similar clients" → Removed (vague, not semantic similarity)
2. "Strong cryptographic privacy" → Changed to "HE + DP" (specific)
3. "Overhead is acceptable because..." → Removed (reviewers decide)
4. "531 GB total communication" → Removed (not logged)
5. "Training time dominates" → Removed (not measured)
6. "GPU acceleration is future work" → Removed (not relevant)
7. Time estimates (~1 hour, ~70-90s) → Removed (hardware-dependent)
8. "CRITICAL!", "MUST!" → Removed (exaggerated)

================================================================================
CLAIMS NOW VERIFIABLE BY REVIEWERS
================================================================================

✅ "50 clients, 16 buckets, n=262144" → In server.log
✅ "Public key aggregation: ~42s" → grep "Public Key Aggregation Time"
✅ "Bucket processing: ~4.5s" → grep "Bucket.*processing time"
✅ "350,000× overhead" → Logged FedAvg time vs HE time
✅ "5 configs × 2 attacks × 3 seeds = 30" → ablation_mnist_lenet.py
✅ "61,706 parameters" → Model architecture in cnn.py
✅ "20% poisoning rate" → Attack configuration in code

================================================================================
REMAINING DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE
